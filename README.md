# SCSS Starter Template

A minimal, flexible, and **fully customizable** SCSS boilerplate designed to help you start styling any project faster.  
It provides a clean file structure, utility mixins, and helpful functions — without enforcing any predefined theme or design.

This starter is **not a framework**.  
Instead, it’s a lightweight foundation that you adapt to your project’s **own design system**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Modular File Structure** — Organized partials for easy maintenance.
- **Design Token Ready** — Placeholder variables for colors, typography, spacing, and more.
- **SCSS Map Utilities** — Functions to retrieve and work with tokens consistently across your code.
- **Reusable Mixins** — Common helpers for media queries, typography, and layout.
- **Zero Styling Opinion** — No prebuilt theme or UI components; everything is meant to be replaced with your own values.
- **Easy Integration** — Works with any build setup that supports SCSS.
